## VS Code

- So when working on code, I recommend _always_ working with a project folder
    - Even for little tiny tests
    - Keep your projects organized, I recommend a folder like `~/projects`
    - Always when working with VS Code (ant IntelliJ IDEA), open up a folder
    - Don't open individual files
    - Need just one file? Create folder with one file :)
    - VS Code doesn't work as well when opening a single file at a time
    - I recommend always opening it from the terminal

- Have you used the integrated terminal yet?
    - Ctrl+J
    - Ctrl+Shift+backtick
    - That's one reason why opening a folder is great :)
    - It's nice using a terminal **in context** like that

- Extensions
    - Did you talk about this yet?
    - These are little parts you can add as extras into VS Code
    - Feel free to experiment
    - I recommend not using **too** many extensions

- 3 minute mini exercise
    - Find a nice VS Code theme!
    - Go to extensions, search for "theme"

- Install Live Server
- If/when you have extra time, I recommend going through the settings of *everything*
