## Clean code

- Remember the "pre" element?
    - Preformatted text
    - Good for displaying ASCII art
    - Good for displaying code
    - It *preserves the "whitespace"* characters in your code
        - Extra spaces
        - Characters like " " (space) or "  " (tab)

- Did you notice how some code has empty spaces on the left side?
    - That's "indentation"
    - Amount of indentation = how nested the code is
    - It's very important to have well indented and clean code

    - Code will always be read more times than it is written
    - Clean code also makes errors easier to spot!

    ```html
    <!-- Messy code with an error -->
    <body><h1>Hi</h1><p>This is
    </p><p>Some<p>code</p></body>
    ```

    ```html
    <!-- Clean code with an error -->
    <body>
        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <p>This is</p>
        <p>Some
        <p>code</p>
    </body>
    ```

- This is true for CSS as well!
- This is true for JavaScript as well!
- This is true for Java as well!

- Writing clean code is vital
    - You instantly see which element is inside what
    - It trains you in recognizing patterns
    - It's slower to start writing clean code...
    - ...but makes you MUCH faster in the long run
    - It's also VERY important in technical interviews
    - When I do tech interviews, if I can see your code I **will** look at it

- Things that help you speed up
    - Write and practice beautiful, clean code
    - Be intentional in what you are doing, like learning an instrument or lifting weights
    - Have a systematic approach to everything
    - Practice typing
    - Use keyboard shortcuts


## A little more CSS

- CSS Can be added in three different ways
    - Inline with `style="color:red"`
    - Internal, using `<style>.....</style>`
    - External, using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">`

## A little more HTML

- Links!

## Basic JavaScript

- JavaScript can do *anything* on a page
- Create and delete elements

- Animate things
- React to user events like mouse movement

- You add JS to your page kind of like with CSS
    - Inline
    - Internal
    - External
