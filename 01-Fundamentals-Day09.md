# Fundamentals 09

**Today**
- Codepen
- Bootstrap
- Publishing a page (GitHub)
- That's it for web dev :)

## Codepen.io

- For those who really enjoy the front end visual stuff

- Codepen is a really neat platform that I want to introduce to you
- It's great for little web dev demos that you can share with others

- 15 minute mini exercise
    - Register or log into codepen (you can use your @dci-student.org account if you want)
    - Create a new pen
        - Include one `input` element and one `button` element
        - When the button is pressed, read the text from the input element
        - Set the `background` of the `body` to whatever is written in the text input
    - Extra time? Browse the "pens" and send really cool ones in Slack

## Bootstrap

- For those who think the front end visual stuff is an unfortunately necessary evil

- Creating pages is slow and kinda hard
- Bootstrap is a shortcut to OK looking websites without know that much CSS!
- This is an example of using libraries / tools that others have made

## Publishing a page with GitHub pages

- Remember the "Java Developer" portfolios Alex posted yesterday
    - They had something in common...

- With HTML, we have now been only working with a local server
    - No one else can access our websites
    - It's finally time to show our work :^)

- GitHub offers a free service called GitHub pages
- It's a hosting service that allows us to server our pages
- It's free (for us, naturally Microsoft has to pay a little)
- There aren't many limitations


- You can use a custom domain, if we wish
    - Repository https://github.com/Req/experiments
    - Normal URL https://req.github.io/experiments
    - Custom URL http://experiment.peltonen.codes

## That's it?

- This web dev is here to teach:
    - Basic frontend concepts
    - How to experiment with (frontend) code
    - Research skills
    - Typing & code editing & window management skills

- There isn't anywhere close to enough time to dive deep into advanced FE stuff
    - This is a **backend Java course** after all :)

- But nothing is stopping you from learning more independently and becoming that "T" -shaped developer

### How to continue

- Practice :) Build stuff

- Follow publications
    - YouTube channels
    - Podcasts
    - Newsletters
    - Blogs

- If you like tutorials, **follow** them, don't just watch them
    - This is really really important
    - Watching tutorials is not really useful
    - You will want to have most of your time "hands on keyboard"
